This small project is a ReactJS application developed during [Rocketseat Bootcamp](https://rocketseat.com.br/bootcamp) using Redux and Redux Saga.

The objective here was not to build a real ecommerce, but to demonstrate how Redux and Redux Saga could be used in order to help in the development of applications that need to share states between components.

The structure used for this application is scalable, so fell free to use in your projects if you want! There are some details that were not implemented, like propTypes to validate the props passed to each component or loadings to inform that actions are in progress.

The fake data comes from Json Server :)
